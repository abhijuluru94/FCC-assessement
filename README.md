## Overview

This project implements a PySpark ETL pipeline for processing data from a dice game platform.

The pipeline performs:
- Data ingestion from CSV files
- Transformation into dimension and fact tables
- Data quality validation (null checks, date consistency, range checks)
- Insights generation (user engagement, revenue, MAU trends, channel analysis)
- Output storage as Parquet and CSV
